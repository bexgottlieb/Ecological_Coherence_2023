# Ecological_Coherence_2023

This is the working code for an analysis I am working on to assess ecological coherence of the Caribbean marine protected area network. The ecological coherence of the Wider Caribbean Region MPA network is being assessed by running fourteen tests to measure four main criteria: representativity, replicability, connectivity, and adequacy. 
Note that this analysis is still being finalized.
